# FakerNaija

FakerNaija is a Python library for generating random Nigerian data. It includes functionality for generating names, phone numbers, state information, educational institutions and so on. This library is useful for testing, development, and educational purposes.

This package does not intend to be a drop-in replacement to the popular Python Faker package, but should complement the package in cases where you need Nigerian contexts for whatever data you need generated.

Hence, both the FakerNaija and Faker packages, can work hand-in-hand for your fake data generation needs.

**Note:** *This project is still in development*
